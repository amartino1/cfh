# cfh
R code for analysis and visualizations for Charlotte Family Housing

These code blocks created graphs and models to help CFH, a nonprofit
learn more about the families they had helped avoid homlessness.

Ultimate goals of the project were to create predictive models
that would allow CFH to determine which future families would be
most successful and how CFH might help more families successfully
remain housed in the future.
